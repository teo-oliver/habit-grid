## F.A.Q

### How do I add a habit to the table?

On the bottom right corner of the screen you will find a big "plus" button, to click on that, fill the input field and press enter. (or click on submit).

### How do I delete a habit row?

Click on the habit name (first cell of the row), a trash icon will appear, click on the trash icon to delete. Be careful, there's is no undo for that.

### Where is my data stored?

Habit Grid doesn't upload your data to any server, yours data is stored on your device. Because of that, you can't sync your data with other devices or between browsers on the same device.

### What about privacy?

All your data is stored in a database in the browser. Check your browser's privacy rules to be sure that they are not getting your data. But you can be sure that HabitGrid is not.

Habit grid doesn't run any kind of scripts to collect data. You can trust this because the app is open sourced and can be audited.
